I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, Robotics Institute. 

My research interests are in the area of Computer Vision and Deep Learning with a focus on Video Understanding targeting both natural and medical image domains.

I obtained my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at CMU in December 2020. Before coming to the US, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from B. M. S. College of Engineering, India.
